# Who am I

Michele Bonazza

<Steps>

- FullStack Dev at URBI.co
- Co-founder at SketchTogether.com
- Backend Dev turned FullStack
- Slacker at dist0rtion.com (that's a zero)
- 95.90.245.241

</Steps>

</WhoAmI>

<Notes>

Our main app is a mobility aggregator (car/scooter/bike sharing, but also public transport, taxis, and recently trains)

We recently rebuilt our main app from scratch in RN, it's in prod (on Android, soon on iOS)

:heart: for python, but lately have been working with Java, Kotlin on the BE, RN and React on the client

# Who are you

<Steps>

Maybe an Android Developer

Maybe someone who knows about Android Development

Definitely someone who wants to know about React Native

</Steps>

</Container>

---

<Container>

# Why

<Steps>

- Most (or the loudest) RN devs come from React/JS
- native side seen as last resort (it isn't!)
- RN (and React) are very unopinionated
- Boy, do I have opinions

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>

RN stands for React Native

</Notes>

# What

<TwoCols>
  
<Col>

1. Intro to React Native

2. Brief intro to React

3. Typescript

4. A bit more about React Native

</Col>

<Col>

5. RN Libraries and frameworks

6. React Native gotchas

7. React Native pros &amp; cons

</Col>

</TwoCols>

</Container>

<Notes>

Intros to RN and React are really brief, I want to focus on real-life development

Most intros have you setup a regular project, so let's skip that

# React Native

<Steps>

- A framework to build <u>native</u> apps in React

- Android and iOS, but also web, TVs, Windows, and OSX ( <Img src={pingu} height={50} inline /> )

- Write once, wait for Gradle and Xcode to build forever ðŸ˜¬

- Declarative UI (vs Imperative)

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>

Linux => react-native-desktop-qt, but no big company behind it

:stuck_out_tongue: it does take a long time to build from scratch, but you don't do it that often

Declarative meaning that not only the components are specified declaratively (XML), but business logic, too.

</Notes>

<Notes>

It's the GDG, of course everyone knows about Flutter

</Notes>

---

<Container>

# Flutter (and Xamarin, and Kotlin Native, and...)

<Steps>

Other cross-platform frameworks exist, each with their own merits

It _really_ depends on your team (do you know Dart? How big is your team? Will you have to hire? Can you easily hire React Devs?)

Fighting over frameworks is **fun** :tada: (you go ahead, though)

More on this later

</Steps>

# React

Note:

<Steps>

- if your team is large enough, _you might not need to learn it_ :shushing_face:

- if it's _very_ large, you might be better off without RN, though :thinking_face:

- it's good to know anyway!

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>

For solos, of course you need to know everything.

For small teams, it depends: a few native devs who know about bridging + React devs orchestrating?

For large teams, see AirBnB (but also, brownfield apps)
