# Who are you

<Steps>

Maybe an Android Developer

Maybe someone who knows about Android Development

Definitely someone who wants to know about React Native

</Steps>

# Why

<Steps>

- Most (or the loudest) RN devs come from React/JS
- native side seen as last resort (it isn't!)
- RN (and React) are very unopinionated
- Boy, do I have opinions

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>

- RN stands for React Native

</Notes>

# React Native

<Steps>

- A framework to build <u>native</u> apps in React

- Android and iOS, but also web, TVs, Windows, and OSX ( <Img src={pingu} height={50} inline /> )

- Write once, wait for Gradle and Xcode to build forever ðŸ˜¬

- Declarative UI (vs Imperative)

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>

- Linux => react-native-desktop-qt, but no big company behind it

- it does take a long time to build from scratch, but you don't do it that often

</Notes>

<Notes>

It's the GDG, of course everyone knows about Flutter

</Notes>

<Container>

# Flutter (and Xamarin, and Kotlin Native, and...)

<Steps>

Other cross-platform frameworks exist, each with their own merit

It _really_ depends on your team (do you know Dart? Can you easily hire React Devs? How big is your team?)

Fighting over frameworks is **fun** (you go ahead, though)

</Steps>
